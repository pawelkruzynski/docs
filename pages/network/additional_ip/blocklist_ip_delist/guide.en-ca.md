## Objective

Blocklisting, also known as blacklisting, is a spam-fighting tool used on IPs (or IP ranges) to block email that is considered spam or may contain malware. If an email domain or IP address is blocklisted, emails from that domain name or IP address may not reach their client - impacting deliverability and sender reputation. Emails that do go through may go to the recipient's spam folder rather than their inbox.

It is important to note that blocklists can include domain names and IP addresses that are not threats to users and that some spam filtering services take reverse DNS into account when evaluating IP addresses, such as SpamRATS.

## Requirements

- You have no open abuse cases involving your services.

## Instructions

### Supported providers

- [Spamhaus](https://check.spamhaus.org/)

    - [Spamhaus Block List (SBL)](https://www.spamhaus.org/blocklists/spamhaus-blocklist/)  
    If the [IP is listed under the Spamhaus Blocklist (SBL)](https://check.spamhaus.org/sbl/listings/ovh.net/), this means you have already been contacted by email by our abuse reporting team.<br>
    The email sent by our team comes from an address similar to this one: `ticket+ABCDEFGHIJ.ID@abuse.ovh.net` (the ticket number is always in capital letters and the ID that follows is composed of 4 alphanumeric characters).<br>
    Follow the instructions in this email to resolve the situation. Once you have taken corrective measures, we will forward these measures to Spamhaus to request that your IP be removed from the list, as Spamhaus will be the sole decision-maker on the action to be taken on our request.
    - [Exploits Block List (XBL)](https://www.spamhaus.org/blocklists/exploits-blocklist/) or [Combined Spam Sources (CSS)](https://www.spamhaus.org/blocklists/combined-spam-sources/)  
    If your IP is listed under Exploits Block List and/or Combined Spam Sources, this is due to configuration issues. Please follow the steps mentioned on the Spamhaus website to delist the IP (see the example below). Once you have followed the steps, you can delist it yourself.

- [SpamCop](https://www.spamcop.net/bl.shtml)

- [Barracuda](https://www.barracudacentral.org/lookups)

- [SpamRATS](https://spamrats.com/lookup.php)  
    If you are running your own email server, you will need to configure the domain name in the PTR record, where the contact information for the responsible party can be found. Only properly configured email servers are removed from this list.  
    You will also need to [configure the reverse DNS resolution](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/configuring-reverse-dns).
    
    > [!primary]
    > **Best practices:**
    > 
    > IP addresses used to send email should resolve to the responsible party domain name. You can also use subdomains for the reverse DNS resolution, such as `mail.domain_name.com` or `gateway.domain_name.com`.


### Unsupported providers

#### s5h.net

/// details | More information...

To request removal, visit [this web page](http://www.usenix.org.uk/content/rblremove) from the IP address that has been blocklisted. You should be delisted immediately.

You can also do this with the tools *telnet*, *curl* or *wget*.

To delist your IPv4 address via *curl*, log in to the listed mail server and run:

```bash
curl -4 http://www.usenix.org.uk/content/rblremove
```

To do the same using *telnet* from a Windows/Linux host, enter the *GET* and *Host* lines after the *telnet* command as shown below.

```bash
telnet www.usenix.org.uk 80
```

```bash
GET /content/rblremove HTTP/1.1
```

```bash
Host: www.usenix.org.uk
```

A detailed explanation is mentioned on the site <http://www.usenix.org.uk/content/rbl.html>.

#### UCEprotect


/// details | More information...

Recently, UCE Protect has placed over a thousand new ASNs on their blacklist. Unfortunately, our ASN (AS16276) has been affected by this. To view the list of other affected ASNs and the number of new ASNs added, please check the following links:

- http://www.uceprotect.net/en/l3charts.php
- http://stats.uceprotect.net/?page=su

Our Abuse team has reached out to UCE Protect to remove our ASN from the blacklist. Ultimately, UCE Protect wants network operators of the newly blocked ASNs to pay for express delisting. Like all major providers, OVHcloud does not pay for blacklist delisting as it is a service outside of our control. Paying for delisting on blacklists only leads to an increase in blacklisting overall and ultimately hurts the industry.

UCE Protect claims to automatically delist ASNs after one week, which we hope will happen but as it is outside of our control, we cannot provide any guarantees regarding this.

If you are currently affected by this, we recommend the following:

1. Use IPv6 addresses to send emails. UCE Protect does not blacklist email sent via IPv6. All of our OVHcloud services come with at least a single IPv6 address which you can configure. All major email providers now support IPv6.
2. Ask the receiving party to contact their mail provider and request to stop using UCE Protect blacklist for the time being.
