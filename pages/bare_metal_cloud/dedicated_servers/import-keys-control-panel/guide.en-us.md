## Objective

Key pairs are used to authenticate SSH connections between hosts, for example a desktop client and a remote server. When reinstalling a dedicated server or a VPS from the OVHcloud Control Panel, you have the option to add a public key to the operating system. Storing public keys in your Control Panel makes this process more convenient.

**This guide explains how to store your public authentication keys in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- A [dedicated server](/links/bare-metal/bare-metal) or a [VPS](/links/bare-metal/vps) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
