## Objective

Enterprise File Storage services can be managed [via the OVHcloud API](/pages/storage_and_backup/file_storage/enterprise_file_storage/netapp_quick_start) or in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

**This guide explains how to manage Enterprise File Storage volumes and snapshots in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- An Enterprise File Storage service in your OVHcloud account. The service can be ordered from the [product page](/links/storage/enterprise-file-storage) or from the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and switch to `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. Open `Storage and backups`{.action} and `Enterprise File Storage`{.action} in the left-hand menu, then select your service from the list.

### Managing volumes <a name="manage_volume"></a>

Switch to the `Volumes`{.action} tab. The table lists all volumes you have created for the selected service. Click on a volume ID to open its [management page](#modify_volume).

### Managing volume snapshots <a name="snapshots"></a>

> [!primary]
>
> Volume snapshots use storage capacity from your Enterprise File Storage offer. By default, 5% of a volume storage capacity is reserved for snapshots.
>

The `Snapshots`{.action} tab lists all the snapshots that have been created for the selected volume.

![Snapshots](images/manage_enterprise06.png){.thumbnail}

> [!primary]
>
> You can also access snapshot from your mount point using the commands provided in the [NetApp documentation](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196991/html/GUID-36DC110C-C0FE-4313-BF53-1C12838F7BBD.html){.external}.
>

On this tab you can also view all the [Snapshot Policies](#snapshot_policy) created for the service and apply them to this volume.

![Volume Snapshot Policy Management](images/manage_enterprise07.png){.thumbnail}

Click on the policy row to review the snapshot schedules details. Select a policy using the circular selector button, and then click the `Apply the policy`{.action} button below the table.

In order to configure your [Snapshot Policies](#snapshot_policy), navigate back to the [volume management section](#instructions) of your service and open the tab `Snapshot policies`{.action}.

#### Creating a snapshot <a name="create_snapshot"></a>

To create a new `manual` snapshot of the volume's current state, click the `Actions`{.action} button and select `Create a snapshot`{.action}.

![Snapshot create](images/manage_enterprise08.png){.thumbnail}

Inside the popup window that will open, you can enter a name and a description for the snapshot. Click the `Create a snapshot`{.action} button to start snapshot creation.

![Snapshot create window](images/manage_enterprise09.png){.thumbnail}

#### Modifying a snapshot <a name="modify_snapshot"></a>

To change the name or description of the snapshot, click on the `..`{.action} button in its row, then click on `Edit`{.action}. Inside the popup window that opens you can choose a new name and/or description.

![Snapshot edit](images/manage_enterprise10.png){.thumbnail}

#### Deleting a snapshot <a name="delete_snapshot"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> `System` snapshots can not be deleted.
> Snapshots with type `system` are essential for the proper function of your Enterprise File Storage service.
>

A snapshot can be deleted by clicking the `...`{.action} button on its row inside the `Snapshot`{.action} tab, then selecting `Delete`{.action}.

![Snapshot delete](images/manage_enterprise12.png){.thumbnail}

#### Restore a volume using one of its snapshots <a name="restore_volume"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> Please note that once a volume is restored using a snapshot copy, any subsequent files or snapshots will be lost.
> When a volume is restored, all data in the volume is replaced with the snapshot’s data. The action is irreversible.
>

You can restore a volume using its latest `manual` snapshot by clicking on the `Actions`{.action} button and then on `Revert to the last saved snapshot`{.action}.

> [!primary]
>
> To restore a volume using a snapshot from before the latest snapshot, you must delete snapshots until the desired snapshot becomes the latest one.
>

![Volume revert to latest snapshot](images/manage_enterprise14.png){.thumbnail}

#### Holding automatic snapshots <a name="hold_snapshot"></a>

An `Automatic` snapshot, created by a [Snapshot Policy](#snapshot_policy) can be held by clicking the `...`{.action} button on its row in the `Snapshots`{.action} tab and then selecting `Save`{.action}.

![Volume hold](images/manage_enterprise15.png){.thumbnail}

After the holding operation is complete, the snapshot type will change to `manual` and it will no longer be rotated by a Snapshot Policy.

#### Managing volume ACLs <a name="access_control"></a>

Access control to volumes works via IP address restrictions. Since none are configured by default, the first step with new volumes is to define IP addresses or ranges from which access will be authorised.

Click on the button `Add a new access`{.action}.

![ACL](images/manage_enterprise16.png){.thumbnail}

This creates a new row in the table in which you can enter an IP address or an address block (CIDR). Select `Read-only` or `Read and write` as the access type in the drop-down menu and click on the check mark button to add this entry to the ACL.

To remove a volume access, click on the respective trash can icon in the table.

### Managing snapshot policies <a name="snapshot_policy"></a>

> [!primary]
>
> By default, every volume is protected by the `default` Snapshot Policy which will create Snapshots of the volume at regular intervals.
>

Adding policies allows you to schedule the creation of snapshots for all of your volumes.

Switch to the tab `Snapshot policies`{.action}. The table lists all policies created for the selected service.

A default policy is already in place which cannot be altered. To add your own, click on the button `Create a new snapshot policy`{.action}.

![Snapshot policies](images/manage_enterprise17.png){.thumbnail}

In this view, you can enter a name and a description for the policy. Then use the button `Add a new rule`{.action} to add one or more rules to the policy.

![Snapshot policy create](images/manage_enterprise18.png){.thumbnail}

Fill in the fields to specify the time of day, days of a month, week days and months for the snapshot creation. You also have to enter a prefix for the snapshots, needed for naming them.

You can find more detailed information for each value by clicking on the question mark icon. By expanding the `Example`{.action} section you can view two sets of policy rules with an explanation of their outcome.

Click on the check mark button to add the new rule. Once all rules are added, click on `Create a new snapshot policy`{.action}.

[Select a volume](#manage_volume) and go to the `Snapshots`{.action} tab in order to [apply your policies](#snapshots).

To remove a policy, click on the respective trash can icon in the table.
