title: Enterprise File Storage - Clone a volume
excerpt: "Find out how to clone a volume from your Enterprise File Storage solution using the OVHcloud API"

## Objective

A **volume clone** is a duplicate of an existing volume that can be used as any standard volume.
It is created from a snapshot of an active volume.<br>

Changes made to the parent volume after the clone is created will not be reflected on the cloned volume.

> [!primary]
> In this guide, a volume is also called “share” as in the OVHcloud API.

**Discover the volume clone feature and learn how to clone a volume from your Enterprise File Storage offer using the OVHcloud API.**

## Use cases

Volume clones may be created for a variety of reasons. Below are some examples.

### Allow access to up-to-date data for dev, QA or training environments

Training, QA or development environments may need to be updated with data from a production environment to ensure that development and training are performed with the current dataset.<br>

Using the volume clone feature, automated operations can be put in place to ensure that the data in these environments remains up to date without giving access to production data.

### Address and remedy logical data corruption

Logical data corruptions can be caused by software errors, human errors or malicious activity.<br>

Unfortunately, logical data corruptions often cannot be addressed with standard high-availability and disaster recovery solutions. By creating Snapshots at a regular interval using a [Snapshot Policy](/pages/storage_and_backup/file_storage/enterprise_file_storage/netapp_snapshot_policy) and with the help of the volume clone feature it is possible to restore the system to a point in time before the corruption occurred.<br>

It is also possible to isolate the corrupted data and try to resolve the cause of the corruption by analysing the problem in a separate system.

## Requirements

- An active OVHcloud [Enterprise File Storage](/links/storage/enterprise-file-storage) service 
- Access to the [OVHcloud API](/links/api)
- An Enterprise File Storage volume with a `manual` snapshot

> [!primary]
>
> You can create a volume and a `manual` snapshot through the [OVHcloud API](/links/api) or the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

> [!success]
> If you are not familiar with using the OVHcloud API, please refer to our guide on [Getting started with the OVHcloud API](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps).

## Limitations

- Only `manual` snapshots can be used to create a new volume. 
However, if you want to clone a volume using an `automatic` snapshot, you can hold the snapshot to make it a `manual` snapshot using the `/hold` API endpoint before using it.

Please refer to the guide [Enterprise File Storage - Hold an automatic snapshot](/pages/storage_and_backup/file_storage/enterprise_file_storage/netapp_hold_automatic_snapshot) for more information.

- Creating volumes from `system` snapshots is not supported.

- Cloned volume size should be **equal or greater** than the snapshot used for cloning.

## Instructions

1\. Identify the `id` of the snapshot that will be used with the following API call:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /storage/netapp/{serviceName}/share/{shareId}/snapshot
>

**Parameters:**
 
- `serviceName`: is the service unique ID 
- `shareId`: is the share to clone from

2\. Clone the volume from the snapshot by using the `/share` API route: 

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /storage/netapp/{serviceName}/share
>

**Parameters:**

- `serviceName`: is the service unique ID
- `size`: is the share size. It should be **equal or greater** than the snapshot size.
- `protocol`: is the share protocol. Only NFS is allowed.
- `snapshotID`: is the snapshot ID to use when creating the share
- `name`: (Optional) is the share name
- `description`: (Optional) is the share description

The OVHcloud API will return an HTTP 201 (Created) code along with volume information.<br>

The volume status will be set to `creating_from_snapshot` and then will change to `available` once the volume creation is complete.<br>
Depending on the snapshot size, the volume creation may take some time.

**A new volume is now created from it's parent volume snapshot.**
