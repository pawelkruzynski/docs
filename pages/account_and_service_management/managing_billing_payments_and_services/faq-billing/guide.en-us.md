## Objective

Here are the most frequently asked questions about billing and payment for your OVHcloud services.

### What is my billing account?

You can view a list of contacts for your services in the `My contacts`{.action} section, accessible directly in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

For further information about contact management, please read this detailed guide: [Managing contacts for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts).

### How do I change my billing details?

Your billing details are the same as your NIC handle (Customer ID). For upcoming bills, simply update this information in the `My account`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

For legal reasons, you cannot change an invoice that has already been issued. If, however, your request is linked to an error on our side, please contact us by creating a support ticket.

### How are my services renewed?

By default, your services are renewed automatically when they reach their renewal date, and your bill total will be debited at the beginning of the month from your default payment method. Please ensure that you save a payment method on your customer account to avoid any of your services being suspended. If you want to cancel your services, please ensure that you do so BEFORE the expiry date.
For certain ranges (domains, web hosting plans, VPS and dedicated servers), you can choose a manual renewal method.
If your services are set to be renewed manually, you will be sent notifications by email when your service reaches its expiry date, with a link to pay online.
If you do not renew your service before this date, it will simply be suspended, then deleted after a few days (the delay varies depending on the service concerned).

#### Tips and tricks

Check the status of your services, and manage their renewal in the `My solutions & services`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.
Log in and manually renew your services on the page <https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/order/renew.cgi>.

For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Managing renewal for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal).

### How do I enable automatic renewal?

Go to the `My solutions & services`{.action} section, accessible via the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel. Click on the three dots next to the service concerned, and select `Enable automatic payment`{.action}.

#### Tips and tricks

Before you enable automatic renewal, please enter a payment method. Please be aware that if payment is not settled after 7 days, your services will be suspended as a result.
For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Managing renewal for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal).

### How do I disable automatic renewal?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, and click on the `My solutions & services`{.action} shortcut in the dashboard. Click on the three dots next to the service concerned, then select `Configure renewal`{.action}. You can then choose manual mode. This mode is only available for certain services â€” e.g. domain names, web hosting plans, VPS, and dedicated servers.

To cancel a service, go to [How do I cancel a service?](#cancelservice)

#### Tips and tricks

With automatic renewal, you can ensure that you do not experience any service interruptions. You will also receive email notifications before each renewal.
For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Managing renewal for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal).

### How do I add a payment method?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, then go to the `Payment methods`{.action} section in the dashboard. Next, click `Add a payment method`{.action}.

### How do I update my payment method?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, then click on the `My payment methods`{.action} section of your dashboard. You can add or delete a payment method (bank card, PayPal or SEPA direct debit).

If you request a SEPA direct debit, you will receive an email within 24 to 48 hours via the email address on your OVHcloud account, with a link for the electronic signature of your direct debit mandate. Warning: the owner of the bank account must be the same as the owner of the OVHcloud account.

Once you have received your order from us, if your mandate has been approved, you can then use this new payment method.

#### Tips and tricks

To ensure that your services are renewed properly, you will need to set at least one payment method in the OVHcloud Control Panel. If you do not have any active solutions, please get in touch by creating a support ticket.

### How do I delete a payment method?

Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, then click on the `Payment methods`{.action} section of your dashboard. Identify the payment method you wish to delete, and click on the trashcan icon.

#### Tips and tricks

If you want to delete a payment method, you will need to set another one first.

### What is my default payment method?

Once you have signed in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, your default payment method is listed in your dashboard.

To change your default payment method, see our [payment methods management guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/manage-payment-methods).

#### Tips and tricks

If your pre-paid OVHcloud account contains credit, it will always be used by default for renewals. If you have less credit than your bill total, the remaining amount will be charged to your registered payment method. Finally, if you do not register any payment methods, you will be sent an invoice via email to settle the outstanding amount.

### When is my next payment due date?

You can view all of your renewal dates in the `My solutions & services`{.action} section, accessible directly in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

Please note that solutions with automatic renewal will be renewed on the first day of the month. However, the frequency may vary depending on the services you have.

#### Tips and tricks

You can modify the renewal frequency for your solutions via the `My solutions & services`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel.
For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Managing renewal for your services](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_use_automatic_renewal).

### Which of my payment methods will be debited?

Your invoice total will be debited using your default payment method. Your default payment method is listed in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

If your pre-paid OVHcloud account contains credit, it will always be used by default for renewals. If you have less credit than your bill total, the remaining amount will be charged to your registered payment method. Finally, if you do not register any payment methods, you will be sent an invoice via email to settle the outstanding amount.

### Where do I find my bills?

Go to the `Invoices`{.action} section, accessible via the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

If there are no invoices listed in the OVHcloud Control Panel, you may not be the billing contact for the service concerned. To see who is the billing contact and modify it if necessary, go to `My account`{.action}, then `My contacts`{.action}.

### How do I pay my balance?

Pending payments are listed in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel.

If you have already set a payment method and your services have automatic renewal enabled, payments will be taken automatically. No action is required on your part.

If you have not set any payment methods and you have services automatically renewed, you will receive an email with a link for payment on the renewal date. You can also pay directly via the OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Tips and tricks

Do you have your OVHcloud username and password to hand? You can pay your bill.
You can also read this detailed guide: [Managing OVH bills](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/invoice_management).

### How do I check my payment status?

Pending payments are listed in the dashboard of the OVHcloud Control Panel. You can pay for them directly online, or wait until the next automatic renewal payment date, if you have set up a payment method.

#### Tips and tricks

You can save your payment method in the `Payment methods`{.action} section. This way, your invoices will be paid for automatically.

### What do my payments correspond to?

Payments made on our website and via direct debit are listed in the OVHcloud Control Panel. You can find the corresponding invoices, dates and amounts in the `Track payments`{.action} section.

### How do I cancel a service? <a name="cancelservice"></a>

For solutions like domain names, web hosting plans, dedicated servers and VPS solutions, go to the `My solutions & services`{.action} section of the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel. To cancel a service, click on the three dots next to it, then click `Cancel my subscription`{.action}. If you have already requested a cancellation, you can also `Stop cancellation of service`{.action}.

The cancellation will be effective once your service is no longer valid, or reaches its expiry date. You can submit a cancellation request, or undo it up to 24 hours before the expiry date.

#### Tips and tricks

If you have made a mistake with your order, you can exercise your right of retraction under certain conditions. For further information, please view the following question: How do I cancel my order?
You can access comprehensive documentation on cancelling all of our products and services [here](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_cancel_services).

### How do I customize the reference for my product/service on my bill?

To make bills more easily readable, the custom names you attribute to your products and services are included directly in the bill, along with the OVHcloud reference.
Also, to customize the names of your products/services (with the exception of `domain name`{.action} products), go to the OVHcloud Control Panel, then to the configuration page for each service.

### How does Public Cloud billing work?

You will be invoiced for resources paid in advance, and additional resources used over the course of the previous month.

#### Tips and tricks

For further information, please read this detailed guide: [Information regarding cloud billing options](/pages/public_cloud/compute/analyze_billing).

### How do I see the accounts ledger?

The accounts ledger is only issued by the requesting partyâ€™s accounts department.

However, OVHcloud offers you access to all of your invoices in an Excel file (.csv).

To download the file, go to the `Invoices`{.action} section, accessible via the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel. Click on the `Actions`{.action} button, then select `Export as CSV`{.action}.
