There are several options for configuring your uploads:

- `Destruct after the first download` - This option will delete your uploaded file after the first download.
- `Streaming` - The file will not be stored on the server. Instead, the file upload begins when the remote user begins the download.
- `Removable` - Allows end users to delete the uploaded file.
- `Password` - Protect your upload by imposing a username and password that the remote user must enter.
- `Comments` - Add comments to your download. The *Markdown* language is supported.
- `Files will be automatically removed in` - Choose the number of days (30 maximum), hours or minutes after which you want your uploaded files to be automatically deleted.
