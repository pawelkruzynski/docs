## Objective

Our Public Cloud Load Balancer  is based on [OpenStack Octavia](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Octavia){.external} and is fully integrated into the Public Cloud universe. 

After setting up your Load Balancer, you can configure it with a certificate in order to process HTTPS connections.

**This tutorial explains how to configure a secure Public Cloud Load Balancer.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- [Preparing your environment for using the OpenStack API](/pages/public_cloud/compute/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api)
- [OpenStack Octavia client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-octaviaclient/latest/install/index.html) and [OpenStack Barbican](https://docs.openstack.org/python-barbicanclient/latest/install/index.html) set up
- A certificate from a third-party supplier.

If you are not yet familiar with creating a Load Balancer, please follow our guide on [Getting started with Load Balancer on Public Cloud](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-01-create-lb-service) before you continue with this tutorial.

## Instructions

### Attaching a Floating IP address to a Load Balancer

You can find the instructions for this part in this [documentation](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/tutorials-01-secure-lb-letsencrypt) in the section bearing the same name.

### Preparing the certificate <a name="preparingcertificate"></a>

For this stage, we will need your certificate, which has already been generated. 

When your certificate is generated by your supplier, you generally receive 2 or 3 files, described as follows:
- Main certificate (.crt or .pem file).
- Private key (.key file) generated during the CSR request.
- Intermediate certificate or complete chain (.crt file), if supplied. Some suppliers already include the intermediate chain in the main certificate, in which case you will only receive 2 files.

> [!warning]
>
> If you have obtained 3 files, you will need to merge the main certificate with the intermediate certificate to create a complete certificate. If your supplier already provides a complete certificate incorporating the intermediate chain, this merging step should be omitted.
>

```bash
sudo cat <certificate.crt> <intermediate_chain.crt> > main_certificate.pem
```

You need to create a PKCS#12 package with your certificate inside:

```bash
sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey <private_key.key> -in <main_certificate.pem> -out domain.tld.p12
```

You must download this file directly onto your computer in order to be able to send it to Openstack Barbican (‘Secret as a Service’).

```bash
openstack secret store --name='cert-domain.tld' -t 'application/octet-stream' -e 'base64' --payload="$(base64 < domain.tld.p12)"
```

### Configuring your Load Balancer


/// details | Via Horizon

In the Horizon interface, open the `Network`{.action} section, then click `Load Balancers.`{.action}

Select your Load Balancer by clicking on `the name of your Load Balancer.`{.action}

You can now click on the `Listeners`{.action} section, then on `Create Listener` as follows: 

![listeners list](images/loadbalancerlistenerslist.png){.thumbnail}

In the first section, called ‘Listener Details’, you need to name the listener, choose the `HTTP`{.action} protocol and the `80`{.action} port.

![listener creation details section](images/listenerhttpcreation1.png){.thumbnail}

In the second section called ‘Pool details’, under ‘Create Pool’ click `No`{.action}, then at the bottom click `Create Listener.`{.action}.

![listener creation pool section](images/listenerhttpcreation2.png){.thumbnail}

Once this has been created, you can click on `the listener name`{.action}, then `L7 policies.`{.action} and `Create L7 Policy.`{.action}.

![l7policy creation](images/listenerpolicieslist.png){.thumbnail}

In this window, you need to name the L7 Policy, choose the value `REDIRECT_TO_URL`{.action} in the ‘Action’ field and then `write its domain name`{.action} in the ‘Redirect URL’ field. You can click on `Create L7 policy`{.action} button at the bottom of the window to create your L7 Policy.

![l7policy creation](images/l7policycreation.png){.thumbnail}

///

/// details | Via the OpenStack API or via the OVHcloud Control Panel

To create a listener via the OpenStack API or via the OVHcloud Control Panel you can use [this guide](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_network_services/getting-started-01-create-lb-service), in the "Configuring your Load Balancer" section.

Then configure the redirection of HTTP requests to HTTPS:

```bash
openstack loadbalancer l7policy create --action REDIRECT_TO_URL --redirect-url https://<your-domain-or-ip> --name redirect-to-https http-listener
```

///

### Configuring the secure Listener on the Load Balancer

Now that you have managed your certificate, you can add a secure Listener and associate a pool and its members with it:

/// details | Via Horizon

In the Horizon interface, open the `Network`{.action} section, then click `Load Balancers.`{.action}

Select your Load Balancer by clicking on `the name of your Load Balancer.`{.action}

You can now click on the `Listerners`{.action} section, then on `Create Listener` as follows: 

![listeners list](images/loadbalancerlistenerslist.png){.thumbnail}

In the first section, called ‘Listener Details’, you need to name the listener, choose the protocol `TERMINATED_HTTPS`{.action} and the port `443`{.action}.

![listeners https details](images/listenerhttpscreation1.png){.thumbnail}

In the second section, called ‘Pool Details’, you need to name your Pool, choose the value `ROUND_ROBIN`{.action} in the 'Algortihm' field and press `Yes`{.action} under the “TLS Enabled” field.

![listeners https pool details](images/listenerhttpscreation2.png){.thumbnail}

In the third section, called ‘Pool Members’, select the corresponding instance and press the `Add`{.action} button at the end of the line. Once this has been done, select port `80.`{.action} as the ‘Port’.

![listeners https pool members details](images/listenerhttpscreation3.png){.thumbnail}

For the ‘Monitor Details’ section, we're going to click `No`{.action} as we won't be demonstrating this part in this guide.

Now go to the section called `SSL Certificates`{.action} and select the certificate that was previously added to Openstack Barbican, [in this part](#preparingcertificate).
You can click `Create Listener`{.action} button at the bottom of the window to create your configured Load Balancer.

![listeners https ssl details](images/listenerhttpscreation4.png){.thumbnail}

///

/// details | Via the OpenStack API

```bash
openstack loadbalancer listener create --protocol-port 443 --protocol TERMINATED_HTTPS --name https-listener --default-tls-container=$(openstack secret list | awk '/ cert-domain.tld / {print $2}') my_load_balancer

openstack loadbalancer pool create --name pool-tls --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener https-listener --protocol HTTP

openstack loadbalancer member create --subnet-id my_subnet --address <private_ip_instance> --protocol-port 80 pool-tls
```

///

You can now access your Load Balancer securely. However, you will need to renew your certificate. Check the renewal policy with your certificate provider.
