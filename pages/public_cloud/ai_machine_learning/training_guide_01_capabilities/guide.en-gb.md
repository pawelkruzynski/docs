#### Logs and Monitoring tools

##### **Command line interface (CLI)**

AI Training is compliant with the OVHcloud AI CLI. Discover how to [install the OVHcloud AI CLI](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/cli_10_howto_install_cli).

##### **Logs**

To check the logs of your job, you can do it via the `ovhai` CLI using the following command:

```console
ovhai job logs <job-id>
```

##### **Monitoring tools**

To see information of your job, you can do so with the `ovhai` CLI using the command above:

```console
ovhai job get <job-id>
```

You can then access your metrics through the `Monitoring Url`.

You are also able to check it from the OVHcloud Control Panel in your job information by clicking the `Go to Graph Dashboard`{.action} button.

### Planned features
We continuously improve our offers. You can follow, vote and submit ideas to add to our roadmap at <https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/4>.

## Capabilities and limitations

### Supported regions for jobs

AI Training can be used from any country in the world, as long as you have an OVHcloud account.
Physically, two datacenters are available:

- `BHS` (Beauharnois, Canada, America)
- `GRA` (Gravelines, France, Europe)

### Attached resources

#### Compute resources

You can either choose the number of `GPUs` or `CPUs` for an AI Training job, not both.
By default, a job uses one GPU.
The memory resource is not customisable.

If you choose `GPU`:

- CPU, memory and local storage resources are not customisable but scaled linearly with each additional GPU.

If you choose `CPU`:

- Memory and local storage resource is not customisable but scaled linearly with each additional CPU.

The maximum amount of CPU/GPU, memory per CPU/GPU and local storage is available on the [OVHcloud website](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/prices/#ai-&-machine-learning), Control Panel and the `ovhai` CLI.

``` {.console}
ovhai capabilities flavor list
```

For your information, the current limits are:

- CPU: 12 per job.
- GPU: 4 per job.

##### **Available hardware for AI Training**

Currently, we provide:

- **NVIDIA V100S** ([pricing available here](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/prices/#ai-&-machine-learning)).

#### Available storage

##### **Local storage**

Each AI Training job comes with a local storage space, which is ephemeral. When you delete your job, this storage space is also deleted.
This storage space depends on the selected instances during your AI Training job creation. Please refer to the compute resources section for more information.

> [!primary]
> **Local storage** is limited and not the recommended way to handle data, see the [OVHcloud documentation on data](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data) for more information.
>

##### **Attached storage**

You can attach data volumes from Public Cloud Object Storage. The Object Storage bucket should be in the same region as your AI Training job.
Attached storage allows you to work on several TB of data, while being persistent when you delete your AI Training job.

#### Maximum execution time

There is no duration limitation on AI Training job execution.

### Pre-installed AI environments

OVHcloud AI Training comes with pre-installed AI environments.

List of available AI Environments:

- AutoGluon + MXNet
- FastAI
- HuggingFace
- Miniconda (Python generic)
- MXNet
- One image to rule them all
- PyTorch
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow

#### Environment customization

Each environment can be customized directly with PIP or CONDA (we support almost any package and library).

You can also use your own Docker images. 

Docker images can be hosted in a public or private registry.

The use of `docker-compose` is not possible.

Please be aware that images need to be built with an **AMD architecture**.

Learn how to build and use your custom Docker image in this [tutorial](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/training_tuto_02_build_custom_image).

### Network

- **Public networking** can be used for all the AI Tools.

- **Private networking (OVHcloud vRack)** is not supported.

#### Available ports to public network

Each job has a public URL, by default this URL accesses the port 8080 of the job. The default port can be configured when you submit a new job.

You can also access other ports by appending them to the URL.

Job URL for accessing the default port (starting with the job's ID):

-   https://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.job.gra.ai.cloud.ovh.net

Job URL for accessing the port 9000 (starting with the job's ID followed by the port number):

-   https://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000-9000.job.gra.ai.cloud.ovh.net

Only the HTTP layer is accessible.

### Quotas per Public Cloud project

Each Public Cloud project grants a customer by default a maximum of 4 GPUs used simultaneously. Reach out to our support if you need to increase this limitation.
