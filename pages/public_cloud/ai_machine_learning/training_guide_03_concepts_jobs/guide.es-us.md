title: AI Training - Job concept
excerpt: Learn the concept behind AI Training jobs

## Definition

A **job** in **AI Training** is the workload unit submitted to the cluster. A **job** runs as a Docker container within the OVHcloud infrastructure.

Each AI Training job is linked to a **Public Cloud** project and specifies an amount of resources to use to run the training task along with a Docker image either publicly available, in the **AI Training** shared registry scoped to your project or the private registry of your choosing that you added. For the latter, see the [OVHcloud documentation on how to add use and manage registries](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_07_manage_registry).

## Considerations

> [!warning]
>
> An **AI Training** job runs continuously until manually interrupted by the user or until it is done, unless it exceeds **7 days of running**. It will then be automatically stopped. You can choose to automatically restart it using the `auto-restart` option (set this parameter to `True`). The job will then restart as is.

- [Data](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data) can be attached to a job to serve either/both as input for your training workload or output (e.g. model weights).
- If you do not customize your resource request, the default requested is 1 GPU. Memory is not customizable.
- [Billing](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/training_guide_08_billing_concept) for **jobs** is minute-based and starts from the beginning to the end of the job's `RUNNING` status. Each commenced minute is billed completely.
- You can read further on job limitations [here](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/training_guide_01_capabilities).

## Under the hood

**Jobs** in **AI Training** are Docker containers within the OVHcloud infrastructure.

## Job lifecycle

During its lifetime the job will transit between the following states:

> [!primary]
>
> Only the `RUNNING` time of the job **is billed**. For more information about jobs billing, refer to this [documentation](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/training_guide_08_billing_concept).
>

- `QUEUED`: The job run request is about to be processed.
- `INITIALIZING`: The job instance is created and the data is synchronized from the Object Storage. To know more about the data synchronisation check out the [Data How it works](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data#how-it-works) section.
- `PENDING`: The job is being started.
- `RUNNING`: The job is running.
- `INTERRUPTING`: The job is still running but an interruption order was received and is about to be processed.
- `FINALIZING`: The job instance is deleted and the data is synchronized back to the Object Storage. To know more about the data synchronisation check out the [Data How it works](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data#how-it-works) section.
- `DONE`: The job ended normally.
- `TIMEOUT`: The job is still running but is about to be interrupted because the timeout was reached.
- `INTERRUPTED`: The job is ended and was interrupted.
- `FAILED`: The job ended with an error, e.g. the process in the job finished with a non 0 exit code, Docker image could not be pulled, etc.
- `ERROR`: The job ended due to a backend error.
