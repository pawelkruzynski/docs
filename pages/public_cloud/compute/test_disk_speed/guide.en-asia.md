## Objective

You'll probably be called upon to check the speed of your disks when you carry out your tests. Whether you want to compare the performance of different disks or just check if they are satisfactory.

**This guide will show you how to test the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) that your disks are able to achieve, whether for instances or additional disks.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud Instance](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Administrative (sudo) access to your instance via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows). (Linux) or RDP (Windows).

## Instructions

### Install the test command

The command that you need to test your disk speed is called `fio`, and is not installed on your server by default.

To install `fio`, establish an SSH connection to your Instance and then run the following command:

```bash
apt install fio
```

### Test your disk speed

To test your disk speed, run the following command:

```bash
fio --name=rand-write --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --rw=randwrite --invalidate=1 --bsrange=4k:4k,4k:4k --size=512m --runtime=120 --time_based --do_verify=1 --direct=1 --group_reporting --numjobs=1
```

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that you will need to modify the `--numjobs` argument to reflect the number of CPUs that your instance has.
>
> You can retrieve a list of arguments and their functions directly from the [fio guide](https://github.com/axboe/fio/blob/master/HOWTO.rst).
>

### Analyse the data

Once the test is finished, you will get a result similar to the following:

```console

```

The line we are interested in is the fifth, which contains the IOPS:

```console
write: IOPS=40.0k, BW=156MiB/s (164MB/s)(18.3GiB/120001msec); 0 zone resets
```

We can see that the performance of the main disk is around 40.0k IOPS.

### Additional disk

To test the speed of an additional disk, you will need to mount the disk with the following command: 

```bash
root@server:~$ cd /mnt/disk
```

### Analyse the data

The IOPS value will depend on the type of additional disk you use. In the example below, we ran the test on a High speed volume:

```console

```

```console
write: IOPS=3052, BW=11.9MiB/s (12.5MB/s)(1431MiB/120011msec); 0 zone resets
```

We can see that the performance of the additional disk is around 3052 IOPS.

### On Windows

### Install the test command

The command that you need to test your disk speed is called `fio`, and is not installed on your server by default.

To install `fio`, log in to your instance via RDP and download this binary: [Microsoft Windows binaries for fio](https://bsdio.com/fio/).

### Test your disk speed

To test your disk speed, run the following command:

```powershell
fio --name=rand-write --ioengine=windowsaio --iodepth=32 --rw=randwrite --invalidate=1 --bsrange=4k:4k,4k:4k --size=512m --runtime=120 --time_based --do_verify=1 --direct=1 --group_reporting --numjobs=1
```

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that you will need to modify the `--numjobs` argument to reflect the number of CPUs that your instance has.
>
> You can retrieve a list of arguments and their functions directly from the [fio guide](https://github.com/axboe/fio/blob/master/HOWTO.rst).
>

### Analyse the data

Once the test is finished, you will get a result similar to the following:

```powershell

```

The line we are interested in is the sixth, which contains the IOPS:

```console
write: IOPS=39.4k, BW=154MiB/s (161MB/s)(18.0GiB/120001msec); 0 zone resets
```

We can see that the performance of the main disk is around 39.4k IOPS.

### Additional disk

To test the speed of an additional disk, you will need to mount the disk. For more information, consult this [guide](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_and_configure_an_additional_disk_on_an_instance#using-windows).

Next, access the disk via powershell and run the same command as above.
