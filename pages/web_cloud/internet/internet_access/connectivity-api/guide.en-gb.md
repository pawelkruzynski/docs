## Objective

This guide is designed to help developers use our APIs to create their own applications.

## Requirements

- an active OVHcloud account, and your login details
- access to the [OVHcloud API webpage](https://api.ovh.com/){.external}
- Read our [Getting started with OVHcloud APIs guide](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps) to get started using OVHcloud APIv6.

## Instructions

### Internet offers

OVHcloud offers various internet access packages that contain at least one internet access but also VoIP lines, emails and domain names.

You can view offers here: [https://www.ovhtelecom.fr/offre-internet/i](https://www.ovhtelecom.fr/offre-internet/){.external}.

Services can be managed using these API endpoints:

* `/pack/xdsl`: Manage Internet package offerings
* `/xdsl`: Manage Internet access, sub-services and options
* `/connectivity`: will replace `/xdsl`. For now it allows to do the eligibility for copper and fiber offers.

### Eligibility

#### Overview

Eligibility methods are available on the endpoint path `/connectivity/eligibility/`.

The objective of eligibility is to resend eligible internet offers for a given *endpoint* (delivery point), in order to order this offer.
An *endpoint* can be an existing address or line, identified by the line number and its status (active or inactive).

Methods return an asynchronous *xdsl.AsyncTask* structure, such as:

```
{
  "status": a string, the status of the task ("pending", "done" or "error")
  "result": an object, in case of success, the method result
  "error": a string, the error message in case of an error
}
```

Here is an example of a pending task:

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "result": null,
  "error": null
}
```

A successful example task:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": { "some key": "some value"},
  "error": null
}
```

And finally an example of a failed task:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "result": null,
  "error": "The action failed, here's why"
}
```

> [!primary]
>
> You should check the status of the task, and try again a few seconds later if the task is still in the "pending" status.
>

#### Finding the endpoints

For a copper line, the endpoint is a line identified by its number and status.
If no line exists, you will need to test by address to see if you are eligible to create a neighbouring line..

For fiber, the endpoint can be identified by a *building* identifier, or an *OTP* (Optical Termination Point) identifier.

An address is identified by a street number and a street code.
To find them, use this process:

1. [Get the list of localities from a zip code](#eligibilitySearchCities)
2. [Get the list of streets for a locality](#eligibilitySearchStreets)
3. [Get the available street numbers for a given street code](#eligibilitySearchStreetNumbers)
4. [Get the list of buildings for an address](#eligibilitySearchBuildings)
5. [Get the list of buildings for a specific line](#eligibilitySearchBuildingsByLine)

##### **Getting a list of localities from a zip code** <a name="eligibilitySearchCities"></a>

Example: we want to search the localities for the zipCode "91400".

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/search/cities
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "zipCode": "91400"
}
```

The response:

  "result": [
    {
      "inseeCode": "91471",
      "zipCode": "91400",
      "locality": "ORSAY",
      "city": "ORSAY"

    {
      "streetName": "ALLEE ALFRED POHU",
      "streetCode": "9147134101"
    },
    {
      "streetCode": "9147132200",
      "streetName": "RUE DU VERGER"
    },
    {
      "streetName": "RUE ELISA DESJOBERT",
      "streetCode": "9147111200"
    },
    {
      "streetName": "RUE ETIENNE BAUER",
      "streetCode": "9147102180"
    },
    {
      "streetName": "RUE FACULTE D ORSAY",
      "streetCode": "9147110752"
    }
  ],
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null
}
```

##### **Getting the available street numbers for a given street code** <a name="eligibilitySearchStreetNumbers"></a>

Example: we want the street numbers for the street "RUE DU VERGER" identified by the streetCode "9147132200".

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/search/streetNumbers
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "streetCode": "9147132200"
}
```

```

##### **Getting all buildings for a specific address** <a name="eligibilitySearchBuildings"></a>

Example: we want the list of buildings for the address "2 RUE DU VERGER, 91400 ORSAY", identified by streetCode "9147132200" and streetNumber "2".

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/search/buildings
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "streetCode": "9147132200",
  "streetNumber": "2"
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "result": [
    {
      "stairs": [],
      "reference": "IMB/91471/C/NT8X",
      "type": "HOUSE",
      "name": "",
      "nro": "91122BUR"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### **Getting the building references from a given line number <a name="eligibilitySearchBuildingsByLine"></a>

Example: we want the list of buildings for the *inactive* line number *"0123456789"*.

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/search/buildingsByLine
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "lineNumber": "0123456789",
  "status": "inactive"
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "error": null,
  "result": [
    {
      "nro": "91122BUR",
      "name": "",
      "stairs": [],
      "type": "HOUSE",
      "reference": "IMB/91471/C/NT8X"
    }
  ],
  "status": "ok"
}
```

We found a single building that is a house.

#### Doing a copper eligibility (ADSL or VDSL)

Possible cases are:

* [I know the line number, I'll use it for eligibility](#eligibilityTestLine)
* [I do not know the line number, I'll have to look it up first](#eligibilitySearchLines)
* [I do not have a line number, I will have to request a line creation from a neighbour line](#eligibilityTestAddress)

##### **Doing an eligibility on a line** <a name="eligibilityTestLine"></a>

If you known the number and status of the line then you can check its eligibility.
The diffence between an active and an inactive line is that an active line has an active Internet access, whereas the inactive line is just an identifier to use to order an Internet access (usually this is the previous number of the last owner, who moved with his line).

> [!warning]
>
> It is important to distinguish an active line from an inactive line. Always verify that the address returned is the actual address of the installation.
>

Here is the request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/test/line
>

to do with the following POST data:

```json
{
  "lineNumber": "0123456789",
  "status": "active"
}

```

##### **Searching for eligibility for an address <a name="eligibilityTestAddress"></a>

This will return an eligibility by address, to be used for the creation of a neighbouring line.
A neigbouring line creation consists in checking the availability of new copper lines by searching for your nearest neighbour line information.

#### Searching fiber eligibility (FTTH)

For fiber eligibility, we have two scenarios:

* I have an Optical Termination Point (OTP) fiber ID, which I will use for eligibility;
* I do not have an OTP  fiber identifier and will use a *building* identifier for the eligibility.

A *building* can be a house or a building with multiple housing. The *building* can be found from an address or from an existing copper line.

The eligibility process from an address is as follows:

1. [Getting the list of localities from a zip code](#eligibilitySearchLines)
2. [Getting the list of streets for a locality](#eligibilitySearchStreets)
3. [Getting the available street numbers for a given street code](#eligibilitySearchStreetNumbers)
4. [Getting all buildings for a specific address](#eligibilitySearchBuildings)
5. [Searching eligibility for the selected building](#eligibilityTestBuilding)

From one line, we have to:

1. [Get the building references from a given line number](#eligibilitySearchBuildingsByLine)
2. [Search eligibility for the selected building](#eligibilityTestBuilding)

For an OTP, this is the simpliest:

1. [Doing the eligibility test for the OTP](#eligibilityTestOtp)

Here are the details for each type of requests.

##### **Searching eligibility on a building** <a name="eligibilityTestBuilding"></a>

Example: we want to check the eligibility of FTTH offers for the building identified by the reference "IMB/91471/C/NT8X".

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/test/building
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "building": "IMB/91471/C/NT8X"
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "error": null,
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "offers": [
      {
        "product": {
          "pairs": null,
          "uploadRate": 800,
          "guaranteed": false,
          "code": "PROFIBER",
          "type": "FTTH",
          "grt": [],
          "name": "PRO FIBER with 1G download and 800M upload",
          "provider": "KOSC",
          "downloadRate": 1000
        },
        "eligibility": {
          "estimatedDownloadRate": null,
          "estimatedUploadRate": null,
          "underConditions": [],
          "activationTypes": [],
          "reasons": [],
          "eligible": true
        }
      }
    ],
    "endpoint": {
      "referenceType": "building",
      "portability": null,
      "address": {
        "door": null,
        "floor": null,
        "stairs": null,
        "zipCode": "91400",
        "city": "ORSAY",
        "streetNumber": "2",
        "housingComplex": null,
        "inseeCode": "91471",
        "ownerName": null,
        "streetName": "RUE DU VERGER",
        "building": null,
        "streetCode": "9147123456"
      },
      "fiberInfo": {
        "nro": "91122ABC",
        "operatorCode": "FI",
        "buildingType": "HOUSE",
        "buildingName": "",
        "buildingReference": "IMB/91234/A/NT6Z",
        "operatorName": "ORANGE"
      },
      "reference": "IMB/91234/A/NT6Z",
      "copperInfo": null
    },
    "eligibilityReference": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01"
  }
}
```

In the result for the "offers" table, the *boolean* attribute *eligibility.eligible* tell us we are eligible for "PRO FIBER with 1G download and 800M upload" offer.

##### **Searching eligibility from an OTP identifier** <a name="eligibilityTestOtp"></a>

Example: we want to check FTTH offers eligibility for the OTP "OO-XXXX-XXXX/C".

The request:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /connectivity POST /connectivity/eligibility/test/otp
>

with the following data:

```json
{
  "otp": "OO-XXXX-XXXX/C"
}
```

The response is the same as in the previous example.
