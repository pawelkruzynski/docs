## Objective

Exchange groups enable multiple participants to communicate by sending emails to a unique group address. With this collaborative feature you can create and manage mailing lists that include Exchange users as well as external contacts.

**This guide explains how to use Exchange groups via the OVHcloud Control Panel and Outlook Web App (OWA).**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- an [OVHcloud Exchange solution](/links/web/emails-hosted-exchange) already set up

## Instructions

### Creating a new group

First, log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), navigate to the `Webcloud`{.action} section, and select your Exchange service from the column under `Microsoft`{.action} `Exchange`{.action}. Click on the `Groups`{.action} tab in the horizontal menu.

Clicking on `Create a contact group`{.action} will open a new window where you can define the group's settings:

- **Email address**: Set a new address that will send messages to the mailing list. Please note that you cannot enter an existing email address.
- **Group name**: The display name that appears in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and in your [OVHcloud webmail](/links/web/email) (OWA).
- **Max size incoming / outgoing**: You can specify the maximum size of incoming and outgoing emails.
- **Hide in Outlook**: If this box is ticked, the group address will not appear in the Exchange service's list of addresses.
- **Authentication required**: If this box is ticked, only users on the same platform will be able to send a message using the group address.

Click `Next`{.action} to continue.

On the second page, select the **Contacts** for the group and designate the **Administrators**. The choices will only include email addresses and external contacts that are already created on the service

- **Administrators**: Email accounts authorized to send an email to all group contacts.
- **Contacts**: Email accounts that will receive emails sent to the group by administrators.

> Please note that administrators must be configured as **Contacts** in order to receive group emails.

#### Managing group delegations

Additionally, the menu item `Manage delegations`{.action} will be displayed. This option allows you to delegate access in the same way as for an Exchange account. Find all the details in [this guide](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/microsoft_exchange/feature_delegation).
