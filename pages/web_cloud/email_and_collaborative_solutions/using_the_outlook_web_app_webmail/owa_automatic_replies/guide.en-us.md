## Objective

This Exchange feature allows you to set up automatic responses to emails sent to your account for various use cases, for example out-of-office messages.

**Find out how to enable automatic replies using the Outlook Web App (OWA).**

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Exchange solution](/links/web/emails-hosted-exchange)
- access to your email account (email address and password)

## Instructions

### Activating the feature

Log in to your Exchange account via the [OVHcloud webmail](/links/web/email). Click on the gear symbol on the top right to unfold the "Options" menu and select `Automatic replies`{.action}.

In this interface, simply activate the feature by selecting `Send automatic replies`{.action}. You can set an exact time period in the fields below or enable it indefinitely.

>
> If you do not specify a start and end time, you will need to disable automatic reply manually.

Compose your message in the editor box and confirm with the `Save`{.action} button on the top left.

### Response types

The instructions above apply to emails sent by users on your Exchange service. You can prepare a separate message for everyone else if you check the box called "Send automatic reply messages to senders outside my organisation". You will then have two more options for automatic replies:

- **"Send replies only to senders in my contact list"**: Only your contacts will receive a message.

- **"Send automatic replies to all external senders"**: Everyone sending emails to you during your absence will receive a message.

An alternative message for external senders can be entered into the second editor box. A typical use case would be to respond with the first message to your co-workers and with the second one to friends, clients or anyone else who may contact you.

### Additional information

- With automatic replies enabled, you will receive emails as usual in your inbox.

- To avoid spamming and email loops, each sender will receive only one automatic reply.
