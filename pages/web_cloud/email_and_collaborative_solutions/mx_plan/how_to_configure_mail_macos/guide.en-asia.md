### Use email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive emails.

OVHcloud also has a web application you can use to access your email address from your browser. You can access this application at [Webmail](/links/web/email). You can log in using your email credentials. If you have any question about how to use it, you can refer to our guide on [Using an account in the OWA](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/using_the_outlook_web_app_webmail/email_owa) interface or use your email address via the RoundCube webmail.

### Retrieve a backup of your email address

If you need to make any changes that could lead to the loss of your email account data, we advise backing up the email account concerned beforehand. To do this, please read the "**Export**" section in the "**Mail on macOS**" chapter of our guide on [Manually migrate your email address](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/migrating/manual_email_migration#exporting).

### Modify existing settings <a name="modify-settings"></a>

If your email account has already been set up and you need to access the account settings to change them:

- Click `Mail`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then click `Preferences`{.action}.
- Select the account concerned in the left-hand column, then click `Server settings`{.action}.
- In the `Incoming Mail Server (POP)` or `Incoming Mail Server (IMAP)` section, enter your full email address in the `User name`{.action} box, and the `Password`{.action} associated with it in the box provided.
- In the `Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)` section, enter your full email address in the `Username`{.action} box, and the `Password`{.action} associated in the box provided.
- Untick the `Automatically manage connection settings`{.action} boxes to display the `Port`{.action} and `Authentication`{.action} settings.
- Make sure that the `Use TLS/SSL`{.action} boxes are ticked.
- In the `Authentication`{.action} dropdown menus, check that `Password` is selected.
- For the `Host name`{.action} and `Port`{.action} boxes, refer to the values in the "[POP, IMAP and SMTP settings reminder](#popimap-settings)" section. **Make sure that the server type (IMAP, POP and SMTP) matches your region (Europe or Asia-Pacific)**.

To finalize the configuration, click `Save`{.action}.

### Reminder of POP, IMAP and SMTP settings <a name="popimap-settings"></a>

When you choose your account type, we recommend using **IMAP** to receive emails. However, you can select **POP**.

- **POP configuration**

|Username|Enter the full email address **full**|
|Password|Enter the password for the email address|
|Server **EUROPE** (incoming)|pop.mail.ovh.net **or** ssl0.ovh.net|

For sending emails, if you have to enter the **SMTP** settings manually in your account preferences, you will find the settings below:

> When you configure your email address in **IMAP** and you want to change the configuration to **POP**, it is necessary to delete the account from Mac Mail and then recreate it in **POP** to change the configuration.

### What do I do if I cannot receive/send my emails?

- If you see the icon visible in the screenshot below, it is a network disconnection. Check that your internet connection is working properly.
