## Objective

With [100M free hosting](/links/web/domains-free-hosting), OVHcloud offers you a 100 MB web hosting plan, and an email account with 5 GB of storage. This guide will show you how to activate a 100M free hosting on your [domain name](/links/web/domains).

> [!warning]
>
> This 100 MB free hosting plan is suitable for a simple webpage presentation, it **does not include a database**.
> It is also suitable if you do not need several "MX plan" email accounts. 
> If you would like to set up a website with several pages and require a database, such as a CMS (WordPress, Joomla!, PrestaShop, Drupal, etc.), please order one of [our web hosting plans](/links/web/hosting) directly from our website or your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> If you tick one or both of the `DNS A record` and `DNS MX record` boxes, this will overwrite the configuration originally set up in your domain's DNS zone.
>
> If your DNS zone is not managed in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), you will need to make the modifications manually in your external DNS zone.
>
> For more details, please refer to our guide on [Editing an OVHcloud DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit).

> If your project will quickly evolve to a hosting plan with a database, larger storage space or more email accounts, you can switch directly and only from 100M free hosting to a **Personal** hosting plan from your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
>
> To switch to the **Pro** or **Performance** plan, you will need to switch from the 100M free hosting plan to the **Personal** plan beforehand.
>
> You can also choose to delete the free offer after backing up your hosting data and the contents of your email account.

> For more details, see our [hosting offers](/links/web/hosting).
