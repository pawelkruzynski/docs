## Objective

You can use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates to encrypt any exchange of data on your website. This prevents unauthorized persons and malicious bots from viewing requests to or from your website.

OVHcloud offers several types of SSL certificates for [OVHcloud web hosting solutions](/links/web/hosting). They are set out in our guide on [Managing an SSL certificate on a web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl_on_webhosting). SSL certificates are essential for the security of your website.

There are three types of SSL certificates:

- Domain Validation (DV)
- Organisation Validation (OV)
- Extended Validation (EV)

SSL encryption levels are the same between these certificate types.

The main difference lies in the level of checks that will be carried out by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issues the SSL certificate and attests to its authenticity.

EV SSL certificates are those for which the verification and security levels are highest. Generally, the EV SSL certificate is used for very large websites or  websites processing sensitive data. This certificate will provide the highest level of identification available.

For OVHcloud web hosting plans, the certification authority delivering EV SSL certificates is [Sectigo](https://sectigostore.com){.external}.

> [!warning]
>
> EV SSL certificates are not available for everyone. To check if you are eligible to sign up for a subscription, please use the information listed in the [requirements](#requirements) section of this guide **before** ordering it.
>
> Please note that once the order has been initiated and sent to our certificate provider / certification authority Sectigo, **no refund will be possible**.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible with regard to their configuration and management. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that they function correctly.
>
> This guide is designed to help you with common tasks. Nevertheless, we recommend contacting a [specialist service provider](/links/partner) if you encounter any difficulties. We will not be able to assist you with **all verification steps of the Sectigo certification authority**. You can find more information in the [Go further](#go-further) section of this guide.
>

### Step 1: Order the Sectigo EV SSL certificate

Sectigo EV SSL certificates offered at OVHcloud are only valid for one of the following two cases on your web hosting plan:

- A single domain name including the www subdomain (e.g. `domain.tld` and `www.domain.tld`)
- One subdomain (e.g. `sub.domain.tld`)

This means that if you have other domain names/subdomains declared as multisite on your web hosting plan, they will not be able to benefit from an SSL certificate.

You can only install one SSL certificate per web hosting plan.

If you need to activate an SSL certificate for several domain names/subdomains declared on your web hosting plan, choose to install a [free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate](/links/web/hosting-options-ssl), or install your own [custom SSL certificate](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl_custom).

#### 1.1 - For a domain name and a hosting already existing at OVHcloud

> [!warning]
>
> **Before you continue**, please check that **the domain name and/or subdomain** covered by your future Sectigo EV SSL certificate:
>
> - points to your web hosting plan’s IP address;
> - is declared as a multisite on your web hosting plan.
>
> To check this, you can refer to our guides:
>
> - [Hosting multiple websites on your web hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_configure_multisite)
> - [IP address list for Web Hosting clusters](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/clusters_and_shared_hosting_IP)
> - [Editing an OVHcloud DNS zone](/pages/web_cloud/domains/dns_zone_edit)
>
> If you would like to subscribe to a Sectigo EV SSL certificate for a domain name (e.g. `domain.tld`), please check that its www subdomain (e.g. `www.domain.tld`) also points to the IP address of your web hosting plan, and is correctly declared as a multisite.
>
> If you order a Sectigo EV SSL certificate without checking the previous points, you will need to make a correction at a later date. You will then need to delete the Sectigo EV SSL certificate you have previously subscribed to **without being able to receive a refund**, then order a new one. The goal is for the new Sectigo EV SSL certificate to include both your domain name `domain.tld` and its subdomain in “www” `www.domain.tld`.
>
> As a reminder, if you subscribe to a Sectigo EV SSL certificate directly for a subdomain (example: `sub.domain.tld`), you are not affected by this situation.

To order the Sectigo EV SSL certificate, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).
2. At the top of the Control Panel, click on the `Web Cloud`{.action} tab.
3. In the left-hand column, click on the `Hosting plans`{.action} drop-down menu.
4. Select the web hosting plan concerned.
5. On the page that appears, stay in the `General Information`{.action} tab.
6. Go to the box labelled `Configuration`.
7. To the right of `SSL certificate`, click on the `...`{.action} button, then `Order an SSL certificate`{.action}.

![Order an SSL certificate](/pages/assets/screens/control_panel/product-selection/web-cloud/web-hosting/general-information/order-an-ssl-certificate.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, select `Paid certificate`{.action} from the list of options.

Then select the domain/subdomain concerned from the dropdown list that appears, and click `Next`{.action}.

![SSL EV form](/pages/assets/screens/website/order/ssl-ev-step-2.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Continue`{.action} after **all items** have been entered correctly.

Proceed with the order until payment in order to confirm the request to create the SSL certificate.

> [!alert]
>
> Once the order has been confirmed, the Sectigo EV SSL certificate request is sent to the **Sectigo** certification authority.
>
> You must ensure that you are eligible to subscribe to a Sectigo EV SSL certificate **before paying for the certificate**.
>
> No refund of the Sectigo EV SSL payment will be possible, **even if the verification procedure with Sectigo does not succeed**.
>

#### 1.2 - For a new domain name and a new hosting

If you have not yet ordered your domain name and associated hosting plan, go to our [OVHcloud homepage](/links/website), enter a domain name in the **search form** and click `Search`{.action} to start the order process.

![SSL EV select domain](/pages/assets/screens/website/order/ssl-ev-search-bar.png){.thumbnail}

Then select your domain name, choose your hosting plan and your options until you reach the step `Configure your web hosting`.

Select your choices for installing `1-click module`{.action} and `CDN`{.action}, then scroll down the page to the section `Secure your website with our SSL certificates`{.action}.

![SSL EV order](/pages/assets/screens/website/order/ssl-ev-selection.png){.thumbnail}

![SSL EV form](/pages/assets/screens/website/order/ssl-ev-step-2.png){.thumbnail}

Click `Continue`{.action} after **all items** have been entered correctly.

Proceed with your order until payment to begin installing your services.

> [!alert]
>
> Once the order has been confirmed, the Sectigo EV SSL certificate request is sent to the **Sectigo** certification authority. 
>
> You must ensure that you are eligible to subscribe to a Sectigo EV SSL certificate **before paying for the certificate**.
>
> No refund of the Sectigo EV SSL will be possible, **even if the verification procedure with Sectigo does not succeed**.
>

### Step 2: Verifications with Sectigo Certification Authority (CA)

All of the actions described in this step might be performed over several days. The time frame **depends** on the checks performed by Sectigo.

> [!warning]
>
> In this step, the entire process depends on the **Sectigo** certificate provider and the information entered when you ordered your Sectigo EV SSL certificate. 
>
> Only **Sectigo** can intervene on this stage and OVHcloud cannot act.
>
> The role of the Sectigo CA is to independently and impartially certify your organisation's information to integrate it into the Sectigo EV SSL certificate.
>
> **Sectigo**, not OVHcloud decides whether or not to issue a Sectigo EV SSL certificate. Sectigo is by definition the only one with authority over the certification.
>

#### 2.1 - Sectigo received the confirmation email

Once your order has been placed, Sectigo will send you an email containing a validation link and a procedure to follow.
Check your information and confirm your request by following the instructions in this email.

To ensure that email exchanges with Sectigo are going well, also check the validity of the email address entered in the form when you ordered the Sectigo EV SSL, as well as the contact email address associated with your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager).

> [!primary]
>
> In parallel and in order to certify the ownership of your domain with Sectigo, a *.txt* file is automatically set up in the FTP space of your web hosting plan. This file will be deleted when it is no longer needed by Sectigo.
>
> Please note that some restrictions applied on your side (e.g. in a .htaccess file) may prevent this verification.
> If the FTP access rights `CHMOD` are also restricted or insufficient, the verification can also be blocked.
>
> We also recommend that you **do not** enable or leave the [application firewall](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_activating_application_firewall), available with our web hosting plans, active for the duration of your EV SSL certificate installation.
>

#### 2.2 - Sectigo Certification Authority verifications

Sectigo will then check that your organisation exists and is registered with the official registries.

> [!primary]
>
> Sectigo may not be able to verify all information with official registries. Sectigo's services may then contact you by phone at the number you entered when ordering, or at the official phone number of your organisation.
>

Sectigo will then check if you have exclusive authority over the ownership and use of the domain name with which you will use the Sectigo EV SSL certificate.

#### 2.3 - Final phone checks with Sectigo

Once the checks have been done by Sectigo, you will be contacted by their services by phone in order to finalise the subscription of your Sectigo EV SSL certificate.

> [!success]
>
> For more details on the operations described in **Step 2** above, see the [Sectigo official documentation](https://help.sectigostore.com/support/solutions/articles/22000218717-extended-validation-ev-){.external} on the subject.
>

### Step 3: Installing a Sectigo EV SSL certificate with your OVHcloud domain name and hosting plan

Once Sectigo has carried out all the checks, their services generate the Sectigo EV SSL certificate and send us the elements required for its installation on your hosting.

You will only need to [activate HTTPS on your website](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl-activate-https-website) to fully use your Sectigo EV SSL certificate.
