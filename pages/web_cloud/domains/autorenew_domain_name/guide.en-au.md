## Requirements

- A [domain name](/links/web/domains) registered with OVHcloud

- Access to the [billing contact](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts) account for your OVHcloud services

## Instructions

### Why renew your domain name?

Properly renewing your domain name is crucial to maintain your online visibility and brand image, while avoiding any additional fees.

A domain name is the address that allows your contacts to visit your website and communicate with you by email. If your domain name is not renewed, your website and email addresses will no longer be accessible. A website that is not accessible for a while can have an impact on your web visibility and organic SEO.

If you have not renewed your domain name before its anniversary date, but you still want to keep it, you may incur additional costs.  
Once the domain name has been deleted, it can no longer be renewed, and you will need to restore your domain name. In order for the restoration to take effect, a restoration fee will be applied.

If you do not restore your domain name, it will become available on the market and can be registered again by someone else.  
If the domain name includes your brand name, take special care. A malicious person could use your old domain name for phishing or scams pretending to be your company.

If you would like to keep your domain name, we recommend registering and renewing it for several years, or enabling automatic renewal.  
If automatic renewal is enabled, your payment method must be valid before automatic payment can be made.

### The different types of renewal

#### Automatic renewal

Here are the main advantages of automatic renewal:

- **Simplicity**: No need to worry about renewal dates, everything is automated for you.
- **Service continuity**: Your services remain active, without interruption.
- **Saves time**: You avoid any manual steps and risk of forgetting.

> [!warning]
>
> If you do not have a valid payment method, the renewal cannot be processed, and you may lose your domain name. Please check that your payment method is valid.
>

#### Manual renewal

If you do not want automatic renewal, you can change the renewal type to **manual**.

This renewal method may be useful:

- If you are not sure whether you want to keep the service until its expiry date.
- If you do not want your bills to be paid automatically from your payment method.

If you choose manual renewal, you will receive several reminders before the expiry date, containing a link to renew the service when it expires.  
You can also pay via the OVHcloud Control Panel.

**Warning**, if you do not pay for the service with manual renewal active, you risk losing your domain name or having to pay a restoration fee (if the domain name is suspended).  
However, if you do not wish to keep this service, you do not need to request its cancelltion.

### Changing the renewal mode of domain names

In your [Control Panel](/links/manager), click on your name in the top right-hand corner of your screen, then on `Products and services`{.action}. In the table, identify the domain names for which you would like to change the renewal mode.

#### For a single domain name

Perform the following actions:

- In the table, identify the domain name whose renewal mode you want to change.
- Click on the `...`{.action} button on the right in the row of the domain name.
- Click the `Configure renewal`{.action} action.
- Set renewal to `Manual`{.action} or `Automatic`{.action}.
- If you choose automatic renewal, choose the automatic renewal frequency.
- Confirm and pay.

#### For multiple domain names

Perform the following actions:

- In the table, identify the domain names whose renewal mode you want to change.
- Select the corresponding rows in the table by ticking the boxes on the left.
- Click the `Actions`{.action} button in the top left of the table.
- Select `Enable automatic payment`{.action} or `Disable automatic payment`{.action}.

### Renewing a domain name before the expiry date

Perform the following actions:

- In the table, identify the domain name you want to renew.
- Click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the line.
- Click the `Bring forward payment`{.action} action.
- After being redirected to an online payment interface, follow the instructions.

You can renew the service at any time before its expiry and also choose the renewal duration.  
In this case, the duration of validity subscribed to will be added to the current validity period. You will not lose any remaining validity time.

### Cancelling a domain name

- In the table, identify the domain name you want to cancel.
- Click on the `...`{.action} button on the right in the row of the domain name.
- Click the `Cancel subscription`{.action} option.

This action is available for services set to **automatic renewal**. By choosing this action, automatic payment and renewal will be disabled for the service you have selected.

### Access domain name renewal bills

> [!primary]

> The bill is available on the day the relevant domain name is renewed (30 days after the renewal date in the case of automatic renewal).

A `Bill to pay` statement is displayed when an invoice is awaiting payment and when:

 - You have services that renew automatically.
 - You have not registered a payment method that can be used to pay your bills.

Simply click the `Pay my bill`{.action} option, which will redirect you to a payment form.

## FAQ

> [!faq]
>
> I forgot to renew my domain name in time, what should I do?
>> Start by checking the domain name’s status using the [WHOIS domain name tool](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/whois/).
>> If it is a generic domain name (.com, .org, .net, etc.), it remains reserved for a "grace period" (approximately 7 days), followed by a "redemption period" (approximately 35 to 40 additional days). These delays vary, and depend on the extension and the rules of the registry that owns the extension. During these two periods, only you will be able to renew the domain name.
>> During the grace period, you can renew it via the OVHcloud Control Panel by following the steps in this guide.
>> During the redemption period, the domain is no longer managed by OVHcloud. Renewal via the OVHcloud Control Panel will incur an additional fee, which vary depending on the extension. View prices by clicking on the extension concerned [here](/links/web/domains-tld).
>> After the redemption period, the domain name will enter a deletion phase that can take several days, before becoming public again. If you would like to use it again, we recommend using the [WHOIS domain name tool](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/whois/) to check its availability regularly.
> I do not want to renew my domain name, but transfer it to a registrar other than OVHcloud. How do I do this?
>> Follow the instructions in our guide “[Transferring a domain name to another registrar](/pages/web_cloud/domains/transfer_outgoing_domain)”.
> I use automatic renewal, and I have been charged automatically. However, I do not want to keep my domain name, and I want a refund.
>> You can be automatically refunded up to 10 days before the effective renewal date for your domain name. To do this, cancel the domain name.
